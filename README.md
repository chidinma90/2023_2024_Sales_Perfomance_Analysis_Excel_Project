# 2023_2024_WhatsApp_Sales_Perfomance_Analysis_Excel_Project
Two-year sales data analysis (2023-2024) using Excel to uncover growth trends, customer behavior, and key performance insights

## Project Overview
This project analyzes two years of data (2023-2024) to identify patterns, measure growth, and provide insights into customer behavior. The analysis was performed using Excel with supporting data visualization and correlation techniques.

## Objectives
- Compare 2023 vs. 2024 sales performance
  
- Measure nominal and real sales growth (inflation-adjusted)

- Identify recurring sales patterns and anomalies

- Recommend strategies to improve sales stability, conversion, and growth.
  
- Identify the relationship between sales numbers and sales values using correlation analysis.
  
- Provide a clear visual dashboard for management decision-making

## Tools & Skills Used
- **Excel** Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- **Tables, Formulas, conditional formatting, slicers, and charts**
- **Correlation Analysis** Understanding the number of sales-sales value relationships

## Key Insights
**Sales Growth**
- 2024 recorded consistently higher sales value compared to 2023
- Growth rate analysis shows year-on-year improvement in total revenue even after accounting for inflation

**Correlation Analysis**
- Correlation between the number of sales and sales value was calculated
- Results indicated that while more transactions generally increased sales value, the relationship strength was moderate (not perfectly linear).
- This suggests that bulky purchases or higher-value transactions also influenced overall sales performance

**Customer Behavior**
- Seasonal spikes were observed between July and November
- December 2024 showed fewer transactions than 2023 but doubled sales value, confirming the impact of larger-value purchases.

**Conversion Rate**
Despite a 333% increase in enquiries, sales growth (40%) remains relatively low, indicating a low conversion rate.

## Executive Dashboard
**Excel dashboard summarizing sales growth, KPIs, and correlation insights**

**Charts Include:**
-Yearly growth trends
- Monthly sales comparison (2023 vs 2024)
- KPIs cards for quick management reference

## Conclusion
- **Sales performance improved in 2024** compared to 2023, showing consistent growth
  
- **Correlation Analysis** revealed that sales were influenced not only by the number of sales but also by other factors such as purchased volume. Suggesting that fewer but bulkier transactions can still drive high sales value

## Recommendations
- Leverage July–November Peak Season by running promotions and campaigns during this period to maximize seasonal demands

- Investigate December’s bulk purchasing behavior to optimize pricing and stocking strategies.

- Increase online Sales Conversion Rate by Developing a Shopping Website (based on June 2025 Customer Survey, Q10-Q16). Customers expressed a strong willingness to adopt website shopping.
